CS 330 Module Eight Assignment

How do I approach designing software?
-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
-What design process did you follow for your project work?
-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I am a little unorginized when I start trying to learn a little of everything before I start so any hurdles don't seem as complex. I decided that having the wedge as the reference point and offsetting other components to create the object. This would allow me to move the wedge position only if I needed to relocate the object. Working with visuilized object and how they interact with the code base helped me understand OOP better, and how simular blocks of code are worked on.


How do I approach developing programs?
-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
-How did iteration factor into your development?
-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

With fine tuning objects position having all in the same render function made navigating the code more difficult. After I broke the objects into individual render functions I could more easily find the object I needed to move. Collapsing code when I don't need anything from that block help orginize what I need to work on. 


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

My goal with this degree is to get the knowledge I need to start building a game either in OpenGL, Unreal Engine, Unity or Godot. Also with the evolution of technology I beleive having general knowledge of computer science is a great tool for everyone. With new A.I technology that can better imitate human interactions, understanding the capability of these A.I models can better keep you safe.
